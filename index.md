## Course Description

Use Excel, Python, and AspenPlus to solve typical chemical engineering problems. Solve realistic problems and explore alternatives that would be inaccessible for hand calculations. Includes equations of state, chemical equilibrium of simultaneous reactions, phase equilibria, plug flow reactors, heat transfer in 1D, and time-dependent heat transfer.

## Course Objectives

1. Students will demonstrate an understanding of fundamental mathematics (including calculus, linear and non-linear equations, etc) in applied chemical engineering settings.
2. Students will be able to use a spreadsheet package to perform engineering calculations including the following: economic analysis, processing and analysis of data, graphical analysis and presentation, etc.
3. Students will be able to solve numerical and symbolic problems with the use of advanced math software (e.g. the scipy Python package)
4. Students will be able to write program structures, and understand when programming is most appropriate.
5. Students will be able to convert problem solving strategies into procedural algorithms.
6. Students will be able to make order of magnitude estimates, assess reasonableness of solutions, and select appropriate levels of solution sophistication.
7. Students will demonstrate an ability to solve engineering problems.

## Software Requirements

As homeworks will be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks, students will need to have Python and a package manager available on their computers. The best instructions for proper installation are found on the [Software Carpentry website](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-01-15-uw/) (scroll down to the **Setup** section). Please have this installed prior to the first day of class. We will cover the basics of Python, Markdown, and GitHub the first week of class to ensure you can properly submit homeworks.

## Conduct

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable by students as they pursue their academic goals. In particular, please review the definitions of academic misconduct found [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) and [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html#7). In the context of ChemE 512, it is expected that all work, homework and otherwise, is the students' own work. Students should also not use unauthorized materials during exams. Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by the College of Engineering.

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to both me and the teaching team. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as early as possible so we can discuss your needs in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts) you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interaction process with you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with state and federal law.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/) available on this site.
