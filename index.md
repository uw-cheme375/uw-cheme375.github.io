## Course Description

Use Excel, Python, and AspenPlus to solve typical chemical engineering problems. Solve realistic problems and explore alternatives that would be inaccessible for hand calculations. Includes equations of state, chemical equilibrium of simultaneous reactions, phase equilibria, plug flow reactors, heat transfer in 1D, and time-dependent heat transfer.

## Course Objectives

1. Students will demonstrate an understanding of fundamental mathematics (including calculus, linear and non-linear equations, etc) in applied chemical engineering settings.
2. Students will be able to use a spreadsheet package to perform engineering calculations including the following: economic analysis, processing and analysis of data, graphical analysis and presentation, etc.
3. Students will be able to solve numerical and symbolic problems with the use of advanced math software (e.g. the scipy Python package)
4. Students will be able to write program structures, and understand when programming is most appropriate.
5. Students will be able to convert problem solving strategies into procedural algorithms.
6. Students will be able to make order of magnitude estimates, assess reasonableness of solutions, and select appropriate levels of solution sophistication.
7. Students will demonstrate an ability to solve engineering problems.

## Software Requirements

As homeworks will be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks, students will need to have Python and a package manager available on their computers. The best instructions for proper installation are found on the [Software Carpentry website](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-01-15-uw/) (scroll down to the **Setup** section). Please have this installed prior to the first day of class. We will cover the basics of Python, Markdown, and GitHub the first week of class to ensure you can properly submit homeworks.
