| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Homework           | 55%           |
| In-Class Quizzes   | 10%           |
| Final Exam         | 35%           |
| **Total**          | 100%          |

## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of a GitHub repository. All written work should be submitted in the repo README.md file using Markdown and Latex (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)). Accompanying data files such as Excel files and Aspen files should also be uploaded with the text file.

Please see instructions for installing Git [here](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-10-01-uw/). See a video tutorial for submitting homework assignments with Git [here](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=847f11be-1154-4c41-9d10-aaff0122ebd7).

## A Note About Collaboration

Everything you submit in this class should be your own work. If you do need to "copy-paste" from the web or from other students' notebooks, this should be clearly cited. Using examples isn't entirely off-limits, but you learn by doing, not by copying. We will follow the [UW academic misconduct policy](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/) for any suspected instances of cheating on homework or exams. Any confirmed instances of cheating will result in a zero. Any 2nd instance of cheating will result in a zero for the entire course grade.

## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Exams

The final exam consists of problems to be solved using Excel, Python and Aspen. The exam is a take-home exam and should be completed outside of class. You will have 24 hours to complete the exam from Tuesday, March 17 9:00 AM to Wednesday, March 18 9:00 AM (but the exam should by no means require 24 hours to complete!).

You may use all course materials to complete the exam, including recorded lectures, homeworks, and notes you may have taken. You are also free to use Google and Stack Overflow for help as well. The exam is essentially open-everything **except** open neighbor. Do **not** communicate with classmates, whether by phone, email, social media, or in-person, or otherwise. You will be required to initial an honor statement at the end of the exam certifying you have abided by these rules.


The final exam will be a take-home exam. It will be available for a 24-h period on *Tuesday March 17th* starting at 9:00 AM to 9:00 AM the following day (Wednesday). It will be administered following the honor system. The following must be abided by while taking the final exam:

* No communication with classmates or others about exam material.
* Students may use personal notes taken in class and all previous homeworks as a reference during the exam. *Students may not access class videos during the exam.*
* Students may use Excel, Python, and Aspen to solve problems on the exam. A browser may be used to access GitHub to download and submit the exam. *No other websites are allowed*.
