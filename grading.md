## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of a GitHub repository. All written work should be submitted in the repo README.md file using Markdown and Latex (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)). Accompanying data files such as Excel files and Aspen files should also be uploaded with the text file.

Please see instructions for installing Git [here](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-10-01-uw/). See a video tutorial for submitting homework assignments with Git [here](https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=847f11be-1154-4c41-9d10-aaff0122ebd7).

## A Note About Collaboration

Everything you submit in this class should be your own work. If you do need to "copy-paste" from the web or from other students' notebooks, this should be clearly cited. Using examples isn't entirely off-limits, but you learn by doing, not by copying. We will follow the [UW academic misconduct policy](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/) for any suspected instances of cheating on homework or exams. Any confirmed instances of cheating will result in a zero. Any 2nd instance of cheating will result in a zero for the entire course grade.

## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Exams

Students will be allowed one 8 1/2" by 11" page of notes front and back. **No textbooks will be allowed**. Calculators will not be necessary.
