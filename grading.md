## Course Grade

Final grades are broken down as follows:

| **Item**           | **Points**    |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Homework           | 55%           |
| In-Class Quizzes   | 10%           |
| Final Exam         | 35%           |
| **Total**          | 100%          |

## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of an Excel file, Jupyter notebook, or Aspen file within a GitHub repository. Written work will be typed out in Markdown (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) with equations formatted using Latex (see Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)).

## A Note About Collaboration

Everything you submit in this class should be your own work. If you do need to "copy-paste" from the web or from other students' notebooks, this should be clearly cited. Using examples isn't entirely off-limits, but you learn by doing, not by copying. We will follow the [UW academic misconduct policy](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/) for any suspected instances of cheating on homework or exams. Any confirmed instances of cheating will result in a zero. Any 2nd instance of cheating will result in a zero for the entire course grade.

## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Exams

Students will be allowed one 8 1/2" by 11" page of notes front and back. **No textbooks will be allowed**. Calculators will not be necessary.
